{"prompt": "Albert writes $2025$ numbers $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2025}$ in a circle on a blackboard. Initially, each of the numbers is uniformly and independently sampled at random from the interval $[0,1]$. Then, each second, he \\emph{simultaneously} replaces $a_{i}$ with $\\max \\left(a_{i-1}, a_{i}, a_{i+1}\\right)$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, 2025$ (where $a_{0}=a_{2025}$ and $a_{2026}=a_{1}$ ).
